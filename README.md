# Seed - Blockchain-Based Charity Platform

## Description

**Seed** is a decentralized charity platform built on the **Ethereum blockchain**, providing a **transparent, secure, and efficient** way to support charitable causes. By leveraging **smart contracts and blockchain technology**, we ensure that **100% of donations** reach the intended beneficiaries without hidden fees or corruption.

## Features

✅ **Transparent Donations** – Every donation is recorded on the blockchain, allowing real-time tracking of funds.  
✅ **Secure Smart Contracts** – Funds are released only when predefined conditions are met, ensuring accountability.  
✅ **Trustless System** – No third-party intermediaries, donations go directly to beneficiaries.  
✅ **Anonymous Donations** – Donate without revealing your identity while ensuring full transparency on the blockchain.  

## How It Works

1. **Select a Charity** – Browse and choose from a list of verified charities and causes.  
2. **Make a Donation** – Send ETH securely using smart contracts.  
3. **Blockchain Verification** – All donations are permanently recorded for full transparency.  
4. **Fund Distribution** – Smart contracts automatically release funds to beneficiaries when conditions are met.
